Contact Centre planning and design Visio Stencil
================================================

I do love a creative Visio. Don't like that bland black and white stuff. In any event, I find that mostly my customers need me to explain some of the call flows, web chat, mail queuing etc. That's primarily because its really complex and at times hard to tell what's what.

A picture paints a thousand words and so the contact centre stencil is given life.
